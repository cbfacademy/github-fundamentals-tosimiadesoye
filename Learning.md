## What I like so far about the course
I like the method of teaching and how helpful the instructors are.

## Some of the commandline command that has been covered include:
*  `Cd`
* `mkdir` 
* `mv` 
* `ls` 

## Some of the Git command that has been covered include:
* `git clone`
* `git push` 
* `git add [code to add]` 
* `git checkout [branch to checkout]` 
* `git pull` 
* `git commit -m "[commit message]"` 
* `git branch [branch to create]` 

## Intro to software development
We were also introduced to some of the software development life cycles like **Agile & Waterfall Methodologies**

  
## What I found challenging
> I'm already familiar with these concepts so no topic has been challenging yet, but I reckon Java would be challenging as it not a language I know.
